### Description
Just a normal/basic website to help in searching & filtering the Caller IDs and Labelling caller IDs.

### Techstack Used

- nodejs
- express
- react (typescript) - webpack5
- antd
- jest

I have used js on server-side code for rending the react application while the react itself is built using Typescript.
The React code is not optimised on performance & also not much documentation as its just basic application to try. I was using this chance to try learning antd designs & also first time in using typescript (although I have used it for minimal works before) from scratch.
